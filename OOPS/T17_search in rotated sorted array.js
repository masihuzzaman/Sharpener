/* There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. */

/* Let's take some examples and see how we can simplify the condition.

Original sorted array
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

After rotation, it might be something like
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]
[6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] <-- rotated and end up the same
and etc..

When you divide the rotated array into two halves, using mid index, at least one of subarray should remain sorted ALWAYS.

[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]
-> [3, 4, 5] [ 6, 7, 1, 2]
the left side remains sorted

[6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
-> [6, 7, 1] [2, 3, 4, 5]
the right side remains sorted

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
-> [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6, 7]
Both sides remain sorted.

If you know one side is sorted, the rest of logic becomes very simple.
If one side is sorted, check if the target is in the boundary, otherwise it's on the other side.

IF smallest <= target <= biggest
  then target is here
ELSE
  then target is on the other side */
