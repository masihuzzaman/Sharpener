 f2, f3, f4, f1

Try to validate your answer and Write Down the Answer for the above Question in details.

Lets categorize the functions first based on their rate of growth:

f3(n) = nLogn is linearithmic.

f2(n) = n^3/2 and f4(n) = n^(Logn) are polynomial. Here 3/2 is a constant as compared with Logn which depends on value of n. Therefore n^3/2 will be less than n^(Logn).

f1(n) = 2^n is exponential.

It is clear from the nature of the functions that the linearithmic function will have least time complexity followed by polynomial function followed by exponential function.

Therefore, the increasing order of time complexity of the functions will be as follows:

f3(n) = nLogn < f2(n) = n^3/2 < f4(n) = n^(Logn) < f1(n) = 2^n)

or f3 < f2 < f4 < f1

Therefore, the correct answers is option (1). f3, f2, f4, f1
