What will be the output (If the answer is INFINITY WRITE DOWN WHY):-

   print(count(1));  //function call   print the output that you get

  function count(int i)     //this is the function 
  {
    if(i>5)
    {
      return 0;
    }
    else 
    {
      return i*count(i+1);
    }
  }

Write Down the output and why you are getting this  for the above Question.

Answer:

The output of the program would be 0.

The count function is a recursive function that takes an integer i as input. If i is greater than 5, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns i multiplied by the result of calling itself with i + 1 as input.

The function count is called with 1 as input, and the value of i starts with 1. At each recursive call, the value of i is increased by 1 until it reaches 6, at which point the function returns 0. The results of each recursive call are multiplied together and returned as the final result, which is 0 it would have been 120 for the base function return = 1..
