Explanation:

The initial call count(1) starts the recursion. It logs 1 to the console, then calls count(2).

count(2) logs 2 to the console, then calls count(3).

The same pattern continues with each call, logging the current value of i, then calling count(i + 1). When i reaches 6, the function returns and stops making further recursive calls.

Finally, the recursive calls start returning, and each call logs the current value of i again, resulting in the output
