Your Answer: */

function sumOfFirstNNaturalNumbers(n) {

 if (n === 1) {
  return 1;
 }
 return n + sumOfFirstNNaturalNumbers(n - 1);
}

let n = 5;

console.log(`The sum of the first ${n} natural numbers is`, sumOfFirstNNaturalNumbers(n));

/* Explanation:

The function sumOfFirstNNaturalNumbers takes an integer n as input.
If n is equal to 1, the function returns 1, which is the first natural number.
If n is not equal to 1, the function returns n plus the sum of n-1 natural numbers, which is calculated by calling the same function sumOfFirstNNaturalNumbers with n-1 as input.
The function keeps calling itself with a decremented n until n becomes 1.
At each call, the result is accumulated in the form of a sum and returned back to the previous call.
The final result is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
In the end, the result is logged to the console. */
