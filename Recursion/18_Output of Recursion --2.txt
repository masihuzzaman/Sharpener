Write Down the output and why you are getting this  for the above Question.

Your Answer:

The output of the program would lead to infinity, and it would cause an infinite loop.

The count function is a recursive function that takes an integer i as input. If i is equal to 5, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns i plus the result of calling itself with i + 3 as input.

The function count is called with 1 as input, and the value of i starts with 1. At each recursive call, the value of i is increased by 3. However, there is no condition in the code to stop the recursion, so the function will continue to call itself indefinitely. This will cause an infinite loop,
