Task details:

Write down the output of the following Question:-
   count(1);   function call 
 function count(int i) 
  {
    if(i==6)
    {
      return;
    }
    else 
    {
      print(i);
      count(i+1);
    }
  }

Write Down the output and why you are getting this  for the above Question.
The output of the program would be the numbers 1 to 5 printed to the console:

1

2 

3 

4 

5 


The count function is a recursive function that takes an integer i as input. If i is equal to 6, the function returns without any value. Otherwise, it logs the value of i to the console and calls itself with i + 1 as input.

The function count is called with 1 as input, and the value of i starts with 1. At each recursive call, the value of i is increased by 1 until it reaches 6, at which point the function returns without a value. Each call to print logs the current value of i to the console, so the output is the numbers 1 to 5 printed to the console.
